"""Sync every dataset of a Hugging Face org into the local dataset root.

This is the one outbound network path in an otherwise local-only viewer, and it
only ever runs when someone presses Sync. Downloads go through **hf-mirror.com**
unless HF_ENDPOINT is already set in the environment.

Why Python rather than the JS side: `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` gives
resumable, incremental, parallel transfers of multi-GB repos for free, and
already picks up the cached CLI token (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`) so private
org repos work with no extra secret handling. The same reasoning put
`export_subtasks.py` here.

Protocol: one JSON object per line on stdout, matching the viewer's other
streaming route:

    {"type":"progress","progress":{...}}
    {"type":"result","result":{...}}
    {"type":"error","error":"..."}

Only repos that actually differ are transferred: the org listing carries each
repo's commit sha, and a local copy already sitting at that commit — with every
file its tree lists present at the right size — is left alone. `--force`
overrides that and re-fetches everything.

Usage:
    sync_hf_dataset.py --org TacVerse --root /path/to/lerobot [--list-only]
                       [--limit N] [--force]

    # one dataset, no org listing; the org is derived from the id
    sync_hf_dataset.py --repo lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace --root /path/to/lerobot
