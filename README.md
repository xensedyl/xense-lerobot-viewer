# XenseRobotics · LeRobot Local Dataset Visualizer

A web tool by **Xense Robotics** for interactive exploration of **local** LeRobot datasets — videos, sensor signals, episode statistics, and 3D URDF replay, all served straight from the filesystem.

This fork removes the Hugging Face Hub remote-loading path; everything reads from your local LeRobot cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` by default).

## Features

- **Local dataset browser**: the homepage lists every LeRobot dataset under your local root with a video preview and metadata badge (robot type, codebase version, episode count). Filter by name, robot type, or **dataset tags** (see below).
- **Dataset health probing**: each dataset is scanned for `meta/info.json` + `data/` + `videos/` and classified as Healthy / Empty / Incomplete. The homepage shows red/amber card borders + corner badges for problem datasets; clicking an incomplete one opens a diagnostic page instead of failing on a missing file.
- **Editable dataset tags** (task / scene / objects): annotate each dataset with a task category (`pick_and_place`, `peeling`, …), a scene (`tabletop`, `kitchen`, …), and a list of manipulated objects (`cucumber`, `box`, …). Tags persist as `meta/xense_tags.json` inside the dataset and power a task-based filter on the homepage. See [Tagging datasets](#tagging-datasets) below.
- **Synchronized video + telemetry**: episode pages play all cameras side-by-side, synced to interactive Recharts time series for `observation.state`, `action`, and other signals.
- **Language annotations editor** (lerobot v3.1 schema): an **Annotations** tab for authoring per-episode language atoms — subtasks, plans, memory, task rephrasings, interjections, robot speech, and VQA. Draw a bounding box or click a keypoint directly on any video for grounded VQA, arrange events on a multi-track timeline, and edit each atom in an inspector. Saves to `meta/lerobot_annotations.json` inside the dataset. See [Annotating episodes](#annotating-episodes) below.
- **Statistics, Frames, Action Insights, Filtering** panels for dataset quality inspection — flagged episodes can be exported as a ready-to-run LeRobot CLI command.
- **Doctor**: read-only, dataset-wide quality diagnostics from [`lerobot-doctor`](https://github.com/jashshah999/lerobot-doctor), shown directly after Action Insights. Runs 11 checks covering metadata, timing, actions, videos, statistics, episode consistency, training readiness, anomalies, and portability; affected episode IDs can be added to the existing flagged-episode workflow in one click.
- **3D URDF replay** for SO-100, SO-101, and OpenArm bimanual robots, with auto-matched joint mapping that tolerates `.pos` / `.position` / `.q` column suffixes. URDF assets load from the public Hugging Face `lerobot/robot-urdfs` bucket.
- **Per-card "Open episode N" shortcut**: jump straight to a specific episode from the homepage card.
- Supports dataset codebase versions **v2.0 / v2.1 / v3.0** (autodetected from `meta/info.json`).

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the package manager and test runner
- Python 3.10+ for Doctor and the subtask parquet exporter
- A directory of LeRobot datasets on disk

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:XenseRobotics-AI/xense-lerobot-viewer.git
cd xense-lerobot-viewer
bun install
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt -e ../lerobot-doctor
PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python bun dev
```

The editable install above uses an adjacent `../lerobot-doctor` checkout. If
you do not keep that repository next to the viewer, install the pinned source
revision instead:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt -r scripts/requirements-doctor.txt
PYTHON_BIN=.venv/bin/python bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The homepage scans your local LeRobot root and shows everything it finds.

## Local dataset root

The app expects a directory tree like this:

```text
<LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT>/
  <org-or-namespace>/<dataset-name>/
    meta/info.json
    data/...
    videos/...
```

The root is resolved in this order:

1. `LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT` (server-side only)
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT` (server- or client-readable)
3. `${HOME}/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` (default)

Set it explicitly when running outside the default location:

```bash
LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT=/data/lerobot bun dev
```

Datasets are discovered by recursively scanning for `meta/info.json` (up to 3 levels deep). The `calibration/` directory is skipped automatically.

### Downloading datasets

Use the standard `huggingface-cli` to populate the cache:

```bash
huggingface-cli download lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace
```

Once the download finishes, refresh the homepage — the new dataset will appear.

## Commands

```bash
bun dev              # Next.js dev server
bun run build        # Production build
bun start            # Production server
bun test             # Unit tests (bun:test)
bun run type-check   # TypeScript: app + tests
bun run lint         # ESLint
bun run format       # Prettier --write
bun run validate     # type-check + lint + format:check + test
```

After any code change: `bun run format && bun run validate`.

## Tagging datasets

LeRobot's schema doesn't carry a concept of "task category" or "scene" at the dataset level — only natural-language `tasks` per episode. This visualizer adds an editable sidecar so you can curate three pieces of dataset-level metadata:

| Field     | Type                      | Example                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `task`    | single string             | `pick_and_place`, `peeling`, `assembly`   |
| `scene`   | single string             | `tabletop`, `kitchen`, `industrial_bench` |
| `objects` | string list               | `["cucumber", "knife"]`                   |
| `notes`   | free-form text (optional) | `"left arm only, gripper repurposed"`     |

Tags are stored per-dataset as plain JSON at:

```
<LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT>/<org>/<dataset>/meta/xense_tags.json
```

The `xense_` filename prefix keeps the sidecar from ever colliding with upstream LeRobot fields, and the per-dataset location means tags travel with the data when it is `rsync`-ed or moved to another machine. The file is plain UTF-8 JSON; you can also edit it by hand.

### Editing tags

Two entry points:

1. **Homepage card** — hover any dataset card, an `✎ Tags` button appears in the top-left corner. Click to open the editor modal. Useful for quick first-pass labelling across many datasets.
2. **Episode viewer** — open any episode, an `✎ Edit tags` button sits next to the dataset name (top-right of the Episodes tab). The currently-loaded tags also render as colored chips under the dataset name so you can verify what's set. Useful for refining tags while inspecting the data.

The editor offers a suggested vocabulary in dropdowns (`pick_and_place`, `peeling`, `tabletop`, `kitchen`, etc.), but you can always pick `+ Custom value…` to type a new label — values are normalized (lowercase, whitespace → `_`) on save, so `"Pick And Place"` and `"pick_and_place"` collapse into the same tag.

### Filtering by tag

When at least one dataset has a `task` tag, the homepage shows a **Task** filter row above the grid:

- `All (N)` — show everything
- `peeling (3)`, `pick_and_place (5)`, … — click to show only that task
- `Untagged (M)` — datasets without a `task` tag yet

The search box also matches against task / scene / object values, so typing `cucumber` will find any dataset whose `objects` list contains it.

### Example sidecar

```json
{
  "task": "peeling",
  "scene": "kitchen",
  "objects": ["cucumber", "knife"],
  "notes": "right-hand only, left arm parked",
  "updated_at": "2026-05-11T12:21:00.069Z"
}
```

`updated_at` is auto-stamped by the server on every save. Missing fields are treated as "unset" — an absent `xense_tags.json` is equivalent to all fields empty.

## Annotating episodes

The **Annotations** tab brings lerobot's v3.1 language schema ([lerobot#3467](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/3467)) into the visualizer so you can author multi-modal language supervision next to the frames it describes. Each annotation is a _language atom_, split into two kinds:

| Kind           | Styles                                  | Stored in             | Behavior                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Persistent** | `task_aug`, `subtask`, `plan`, `memory` | `language_persistent` | Holds across the episode (broadcast) |
| **Event**      | `interjection`, `vqa`, speech (`say`)   | `language_events`     | Fires at a specific frame timestamp  |

What the tab gives you:

- **Quick-add bar** for text atoms (subtask / plan / memory / task rephrasing / robot speech / non-spatial VQA).
- **Grounded VQA** — drag a bounding box or click a keypoint directly on any video. The gesture becomes a `Where is the X?` / `Point to the X.` Q&A pair tied to the camera you drew on.
- **Multi-track timeline** — one lane per atom kind; click to seek, drag a playhead, and drag-create / edge-resize subtask spans.
- **Inspector** — select any atom to edit its content, timestamp (snapped to the nearest source frame), or camera tag.

### How annotations are stored

Saving writes a per-dataset JSON sidecar:

```
<LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT>/<org>/<dataset>/meta/lerobot_annotations.json
```

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "episodes": {
    "0": {
      "atoms": [
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "pick up the box",
          "style": "subtask",
          "timestamp": 1.5,
          "camera": null,
          "tool_calls": null
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "updated_at": "2026-06-22T14:13:58.714Z"
}
```

On load, atoms are read with this precedence: **unsaved in-session edits → the JSON sidecar → atoms already embedded in the parquet** (`language_persistent` / `language_events`). A dataset that ships with the columns renders immediately; a dataset without them starts blank.

This fork is **local-only**: there is no FastAPI backend and no push-to-Hub. Writing annotations back into the dataset's `data/chunk-*/file-*.parquet` (the lerobot export path) is intentionally **not** implemented — the JSON sidecar is the source of truth, and the visualizer reads it directly. Because saving writes into the dataset's `meta/` directory, mount your dataset root **writable** (drop the `:ro` flag in the Docker examples below) if you want to persist edits.

## Architecture notes

- Dataset files are served by an internal route `/api/local-datasets/[encodedPath]/[...filePath]` with HTTP range support for video streaming.
- The Doctor tab posts to `…/[encodedPath]/doctor`, which invokes `scripts/run_lerobot_doctor.py` in a bounded child process (5-minute timeout and 10 MiB output cap). It is read-only, defaults to the first 25 episodes for parquet-backed checks, and can be rerun against 10/25/50/100 episodes or the full dataset.
- Dataset-level sidecars are read/written through dedicated routes: `…/[encodedPath]/tags` (`xense_tags.json`) and `…/[encodedPath]/annotations` (`lerobot_annotations.json`).
- The homepage discovers datasets via `src/lib/local-datasets-discovery.ts`.
- All cloud/HF Hub loading code (OAuth, proxy, search) has been removed.
- URDF/mesh assets for the 3D replay still load from `https://huggingface.co/buckets/lerobot/robot-urdfs/` (override with `NEXT_PUBLIC_URDF_BASE_URL`).

## Docker

The Docker image includes the pinned `lerobot-doctor` Python runtime. The
Dockerfile declares a `VOLUME ["/data/lerobot"]` and defaults
`LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT=/data/lerobot` — mount your host LeRobot cache there:

```bash
docker build -t xense-lerobot-visualizer .

# Bind-mount the host cache (read-only is fine):
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot:/data/lerobot:ro \
  xense-lerobot-visualizer

# Or point at a different host path:
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -v /mnt/big-disk/lerobot-data:/data/lerobot:ro \
  xense-lerobot-visualizer
```

Open <http://localhost:7860>.

If you keep datasets in several places, override the env directly:

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 \
  -v /srv/datasets:/srv/datasets:ro \
  -e LOCAL_DATASET_ROOT=/srv/datasets \
  xense-lerobot-visualizer
```
